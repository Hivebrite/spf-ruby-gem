= SPF

The +spf+ Ruby gem, also known as +spf-ruby+, is an implementation of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) e-mail sender
authentication system.

See <http://www.openspf.org> for more information about SPF.

Note: This gem is currently very early in its lifecycle.  The API is *not* guaranteed to be stable.

== Usage

<tt>
  require 'spf'

  spf_server = SPF::Server.new

  request = SPF::Request.new(
    versions:      [1, 2],             # optional
    scope:         'mfrom',            # or 'helo', 'pra'
    identity:      'fred@example.com',
    ip_address:    '192.168.0.1',
    helo_identity: 'mta.example.com'   # optional
  )

  result = spf_server.process(request)

  puts result
  
  result_code   = result.code # :pass, :fail, etc.
